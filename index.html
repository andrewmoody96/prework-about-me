      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an audio engineer, guitarist, and sales representative.</p>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Since I can remember, I've always enjoyed computers. How they work and why they work the way they do has always facinated me. Web development is a way that I can interact with computers and still channel my creative side into my work. It allows me to continue building the Internet as it further envelops our existence.</p>
